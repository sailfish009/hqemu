# Union branch 'type'
# Reject this, because we would have a clash in generated C, between the
# simple union's implicit tag member 'kind' and the branch name 'kind'
# within the union.
# TODO: Even when the generated C is switched to use 'type' rather than
# 'kind', to match the QMP spelling, the collision should still be detected.
# Or, we could munge the branch name to allow compilation.
